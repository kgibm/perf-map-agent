A java agent to generate /tmp/perf-<pid>.map files for JITted methods for use with `perf`

## Build

    export JAVA_HOME=${PATH_TO_JDK}
    cmake .
    make

## Use

Add `-agentpath:<dir>/libperfmap.so` to the java command line.

Note: If `perf top` still doesn't show any detailled info it's probably because of a permission problem. A common solution is
to run the java program as a regular user with the agent enabled and then run a `chown root /tmp/perf-<pid>.map` to make
the file accessible for the root user. Then run `perf top` as root. You could use the following script to do that:

```sh
sudo chown root /tmp/perf-$1.map
sudo perf top
```
